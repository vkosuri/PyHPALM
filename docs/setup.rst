Installation
============

Installing from source
----------------------

1. Download a copy of the code from GitHub. You may need to install `git`_. ::

    git clone https://github.com/vkosuri/py-hpalm.git

2. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid need of ``sudo``. ::

    virtuenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

3. Upgrade pip after activating the virtual environment. ::
    
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
